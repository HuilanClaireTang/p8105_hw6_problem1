# **NYC Restaurant Inspections | DSI | Assignment 6**
### `Huilan Tang | Candace Haghighi`

***

> Our group aimed to explore restaurant inspections scores and cuisine types in relation to location for restaurants in New York City. The data was extracted from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), which includes information such as restaurant name and location, type of food, inspection date, and details on violation codes, total scores, and associated grades. Restaurant inspection scores ranged from -1 to 86, with the score being a count of the number of total violations (the higher the score the more the number of violations). Our interactive visualizations using Shiny and flexdashboards allow users to look at variations of Boroughs in NYC, health grade, and zipcode to quickly analyze trends in health code violations.
